# VPT-LR (VPT Local Rendering or VPT Lazy Ripoff)
Based on [VPT web application](https://github.com/terier/vpt) by Å½iga Lesar

A command-line application for rendering images from volumetric data, written in Rust and using WebGPU.

## How to run
There are Linux binaries in the release section. The binary is run in command line.

## How to build
To build the script for the specific system, install Rust and Cargo, and run ``cargo build --release``. More about compiling rust applications can be found [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/commands/cargo-build.html).

## Options
Script accepts settings and required data throught script arguments listed below:

* `--volume` *(required)*: A string representing path to file with raw volumetric data (currently accepts only .raw format)
* `--volume-dimensions` *(optional)*: Three integers representing width, height and depth of the volumetric texture (defaults to: authomatically calculated values)
* `--tf` *(optional)*: A string representing path to file with transfer function texture (defaults to: [0,0,0,255, 1,0,0,255])
* `--camera-position` *(optional)*: Three floats representing x,y,z coordinates of camera in the scene (defaults to: [-1.0, -1.0, 1.0])
* `--out-resolution` *(optional)*: An integer representing resolution of output image (defaults to: 512)
* `--output` *(optional)*: A string representing path to the output image file (defaults to: output.ppm)
* `--steps` *(optional)*: An integer representing number of rendering steps (defaults to: 100)
* `--anisotropy` *(optional)*: A float representing anisotropy (defaults to: 0.0)
* `--extinction` *(optional)*: A float representing extinction (defaults to: 100.0)
* `--bounces` *(optional)*: An integer representing number of bounces per photon (defaults to: 8.0)

The supported formats for volume data files are:
- raw 3D texture array where each value is a single parameter as unsigned 8-bit integer

The supported formats for transfer function files are:
- 2D texture array where each value contains four parameters RGBA, each being an unsigned 8-bit integer

The program outputs an image in [PPM format version P3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netpbm).
